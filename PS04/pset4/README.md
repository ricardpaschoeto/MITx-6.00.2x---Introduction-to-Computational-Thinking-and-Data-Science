# Introduction
In this problem set, you will use regression analysis to model the climate of different areas and try to find evidence of global warming. You will create models to analyze and visualize climate change in terms of temperature. 

Please do not rename the files we provide you with, change any of the provided helper functions, change function/method names, or delete provided docstrings. You will need to keep data.csv in the same folder as ps4.py.

To model the change in climate of an area, you will need some data. For this problem set, we will use temperature data obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The data, stored in data.csv , contains the average temperatures observed in 21 U.S. cities from 1961 to 2015. Open the file, and take a look at the raw data.

In order to parse the raw data, in ps4.py w e have implemented a helper class Climate. You can initialize an instance of the Climate class by providing the filename of the raw data. Look over this class and read its docstrings to figure out how to get data for the following problems.

## Problem 1: Curve Fitting
